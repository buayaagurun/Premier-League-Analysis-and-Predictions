# Premier-League-Analysist-and-Predictions

This is my first full project to do data things, i have Premier League fixtures & result from 2019/2020 until GW 18 2022/2023 season from scrapping a website http://fbref.com as my dataset. In this repository i create 3 things:
1. Scrapping website for my dataset
2. Visualize and analyzing what i got from the dataset
3. Make Neural Network Model to predict result from Premier League match

Shout out to dataquest channel on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@Dataquestio) to give the tutorial and gave me an idea how i start my data project
